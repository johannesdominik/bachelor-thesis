\chapter{Use Cases of Decentralized Finance 10}
\label{cha:UseCasesDecentralizedFinance}

This chapter aims to introduce the five most relevant use cases of Decentralized Finance. Each use case is built on top of the previous one and rises in complexity. For example storing value in digital systems is pretty easy nowadays but moving real physical assets such as gold or real estate is still pretty demanding. Note that each type of financial service is not DeFi specific, which means that they are applicable to every financial environment.
