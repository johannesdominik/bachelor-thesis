The main component of decentralized web applications are Smart Contracts. Smart Contracts can be written in a few different programming languages such as LLL, Serpent, Solidity, Vyper and Bamboo. Solidity is by far the most popular and currently the de-facto standard in writing smart contracts \cite{AntonopoulosWood2018}. Solidity is statically typed, has a JavaScript-like syntax and supports various popular programming concepts such as object-orientation \cite{SolidityDocumentation}\cite{Solidity}.
