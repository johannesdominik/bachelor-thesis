\section{Cryptography}

The term "cryptocurrency" already suggests, that blockchains rely heavily on cryptography. But cryptography is an even broader topic and exceeds by far the ranges of blockchains, cryptocurrencies and decentralization. Without crytography, our digital life would be very different today. Cryptography is the theory of data encryption, which means "secret writing" in Greek. Together with cryptoanalysis, which is the opposite (decoding data), cryptographic can be conflated as cryptology. Cryptography makes it possible to make data content unreadable for specific people, detect unauthorized data manipulation and guarantee the authenticity of a communication parter. What cryptography cannot achieve, is prevention of unauthorized data manipulation and the prevention that data is being read at all.
