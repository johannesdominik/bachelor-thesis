\chapter{Abstract}

\textit{Use Cases and Design of Web Applications in Decentralized Finance} describes the major fields of applications of decentralized financial
software. Each use case is described in detail, to create a profound understanding of the technical design and operation of each of them.

It is split up in two major parts. The first part describes the financial use cases in a more abstract and high-level manner. The second part lays
down a possible implementation design, based on a very specific example of a web application that implements those uses cases. While the reference
implementation is written in Solidity, a high level programming language for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, there is a slight
focus on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as well. A separate chapter is dedicated to discuss criticism and potential risks of this new financial
ecosystem.
